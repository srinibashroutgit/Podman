What is Podman?
Podman is a daemonless container engine that allows you to run containers without a separate daemon process. It's a popular alternative to Docker.

Overview
- Daemonless: Podman doesn't require a separate daemon process to run containers.
- Docker-compatible: Podman is compatible with Docker images and containers.
- Secure: Podman uses a more secure architecture than Docker.

Podman Overview (Simple Lines)
Open-source tool to run containers and pods

Supports OCI (Open Container Initiative) standards

Works without a central daemon

Can run containers as non-root users (secure!)

CLI is Docker-compatible (you can alias docker to podman)

Supports pods, just like Kubernetes!


Podman Architecture
Component			Description
CLI			User interacts using podman commands
No Daemon		Each command runs as a short-lived process
Containers		Runs in isolated processes via runc or crun
Storage			Uses local filesystem or overlayfs for images
Network			Uses CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins
Pods (optional)		Groups of containers sharing network namespace

Podman can even generate systemd services for container auto-start!

Podman vs Docker
Feature			Docker			Podman
Daemon-based		✅ Yes (dockerd)	❌ No daemon
Rootless containers	⚠️ Optional, complex	✅ Built-in
Docker-compatible CLI	✅ Yes			✅ Yes (drop-in replacement)
Pod support		❌ No			✅ Yes (like Kubernetes)
Systemd integration	⚠️ Manual		✅ Built-in
OCI-compliance		✅ Yes				✅ Yes
Remote management	✅ Docker Desktop/API	✅ Via podman-remote


Architecture
- Client-server model: Podman uses a client-server model, but the server is built into the Podman binary.
- Container runtime: Podman uses a container runtime (e.g., runc) to run containers.
- Image management: Podman manages images using a local cache.

Comparison with Docker
- Daemon: Docker requires a separate daemon process, while Podman doesn't.
- Security: Podman's daemonless architecture is more secure than Docker's.
- Performance: Podman is often faster than Docker due to its lightweight architecture.
- Compatibility: Podman is compatible with Docker images and containers.

Key differences
- Docker:
    - Requires a separate daemon process.
    - Can be slower due to the daemon overhead.
- Podman:
    - Daemonless architecture.
    - Faster and more secure.

When to use Podman
- Security-critical environments: Podman's daemonless architecture makes it a good choice for security-critical environments.
- Resource-constrained environments: Podman's lightweight architecture makes it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

When to use Docker
- Existing Docker infrastructure: If you're already invested in Docker, it might be easier to stick with it.
- Large-scale deployments: Docker's ecosystem and community support make it a popular choice for large-scale deployments.
